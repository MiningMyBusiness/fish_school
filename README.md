# Simulation of flocking, swarming, and schooling behavior

A codebase with agent-based modeling of flocking, swarming, and schooling behavior coded in Processing (https://processing.org/). Implements algorithms for fish schooling presented in Barbaro et al 2009, Modelling and simulations of the migration of pelagic fish (https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/66/5/826/663038). Extends the algorithms with the presence of predators and food sources.
